# cd
1. When I used the cd command without any arguments, it kept me in the same directory I was in.
   ```
   [user@sahara ~]$ cd
   [user@sahara ~]$
   ```
2. When I used the cd command with a directory as the argument, it brought me into the directory that I specified.
   ```
   [user@sahara ~]$ cd lecture1
   [user@sahara ~/lecture1]$
   ```
3. When I used the cd command with a file as the argument, the terminal tsaid that the file was not a directory.
   ```
   [user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ cd messages
   [user@sahara ~/lecture1/messages]$ cd no.txt
   bash: cd: no.txt: Not a directory
   ```
